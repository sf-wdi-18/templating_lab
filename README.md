#Templating Lab

Today we're going to explore some approaches to html templating on the frontend.

##Goal

* Practice html templating using jQuery and Underscore
    - End Result: A rendered list of food items
* Build a simple node app that serves a list of food items:
    - End Result: Visiting `/` returns `public/views/index.html`
    - Making a AJAX/GET request to `/foods` returns a list of food items to the frontend
